# ðŸ“˜ Singly Linked List in JavaScript

A **Singly Linked List** is a linear data structure made up of nodes. Each **node** stores:

- A **data** value
- A **reference** to the next node in the list (`next`)

The list is traversed **forward** only, starting from a special node called the **head**.

## ðŸ”§ Working Mechanism

The singly linked list has two main components:

1. **`Node` Class** â€“ Represents a single item in the list
2. **`SinglyLinkedList` Class** â€“ Manages the chain of nodes

Each `Node` object points to the **next node** in the sequence, and the list itself keeps track of where it starts using the `head`.
